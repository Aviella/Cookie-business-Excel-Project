# Cookie business Excel Project
## Analysing "Kevin Cookie Company" Business data in order to strategise for better business
# Kevin Cookie Company Dashboard 🥠📊

Welcome to the Kevin Cookie Company Dashboard project! This project utilizes the **Kevin Cookie Company Dataset (2019-2020)** to analyze sales data and generate an interactive dashboard with three key visualizations.

## 📝 Project Overview

In this project, I used **Excel** to clean, filter, format, and perform calculations on the dataset. After preparing the data, I imported it into a visualization tool to create interactive and insightful visuals.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, filtering, formatting, and formula-based calculations.
- **Excel Pivot Tables**: For creating interactive visuals and dashboards.

## 📊 Visualizations

1. **Units Sold by Country and Product 🌍🍪**  
   A summary of the units sold, broken down by country and product type. This visual provides insights into which products are the best sellers in different regions.

## 🧑‍💻 Steps Involved

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   Cleaned and formatted the dataset using Excel to ensure it is ready for analysis. Removed duplicates, corrected errors, and standardized data entries.

2. **Data Filtering & Formatting**:  
   Applied filters to narrow down the dataset to relevant information. Used Excel's built-in functions to format the data for easier visualization.

3. **Calculations & Formulas**:  
   Used Excel formulas to perform necessary calculations such as revenue totals, profit margins, and other key metrics.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:  
   I used Pivot tables to make graphs for my cleaned data. I then built an interactive dashboard with dynamic filters and charts (using slicers).

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Top Performing Countries**: The dashboard highlights which countries are contributing the most to the sales and revenue.
- **Best-Selling Products**: Understand which products are the best sellers and which ones need improvement.
- **Seasonal Profit Trends**: The monthly profit summary shows trends that could inform marketing and production decisions.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add more detailed visualizations, such as customer demographics or time-based trends.
- Incorporate predictive analysis for future sales and profit trends.
- Enhance dashboard interactivity with advanced filters.
