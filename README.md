# Cookie business Excel Project
## Analysing "Kevin Cookie Company" Business data in order to strategise for better business
# Kevin Cookie Company Dashboard 🥠📊

Welcome to the Kevin Cookie Company Dashboard project! This project utilizes the **Kevin Cookie Company Dataset (2019-2020)** to analyze sales data and generate an interactive dashboard with three key visualizations.

## 📝 Project Overview

In this project, I used **Excel** to clean, filter, format, and perform calculations on the dataset. After preparing the data, I created interactive and insightful visuals.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, filtering, formatting, and formula-based calculations.
- **Excel Pivot Tables**: For creating interactive visuals and dashboards.

## 📊 Visualizations

1. **Units Sold by Country and Product 🌍🍪**  
   A summary of the units sold, broken down by country and product type. This visual provides insights into which products are the best sellers in different regions.

2. **Revenue Summary 💰**  
   This visual shows the total revenue generated across all countries and products, helping to highlight the overall financial performance of the company.

## 🧑‍💻 Steps Involved

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   Cleaned and formatted the dataset using Excel to ensure it is ready for analysis. Removed duplicates, corrected errors, and standardized data entries.

2. **Data Filtering & Formatting**:  
   Applied filters to narrow down the dataset to relevant information. Used Excel's built-in functions to format the data for easier visualization.

3. **Calculations & Formulas**:  
   Used Excel formulas to perform necessary calculations such as revenue totals, profit margins, and other key metrics.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:  
   I used Pivot tables to make graphs for my cleaned data. I then built an interactive dashboard with dynamic filters and charts (using slicers).

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Top Performing Countries**: My hypothesis about USA being our biggest customer was incorrect. India in fact were out biggest customer

- **Best-Selling Products**: I correctly predicted that Chocolate chip cookies would sell the most units as they are a quite popular simple cookie. Chocolate chip cookies sold the most units – 338243, almost double the the next best seller which were sugar cookies (which sold 16787 units)


- **Seasonal Profit Trends**: I hypothesised that units sold and profit will be highest in December due to the Christmas period and people buying cookies as gifts or to have as Christmas snacks. This was incorrect. These figures peaked in October. During May and   August our units sold are really low.


## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Incorporate predictive analysis for future sales and profit trends.
